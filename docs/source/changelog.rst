This is a high level and scarce summary of the changes between releases.
We would recommend to consult log of the `DataLad git
repository <http://github.com/datalad/datalad-crawler>`__ for more
details.

0.4.4 (Nov 20, 2019) – … despite some mocking
---------------------------------------------

-  ENH: ``s3_simple`` pipeline got additional option
   ``drop_immediately`` to drop files immediately upon having them
   annexed
-  RF: ``mock`` is explicitly listed as a dependency for testing since
   DataLad 0.12.x will be PY3 only and could use built-in
   ``unittest.mock``

0.4.3 (Oct 30, 2019) – … and help each other
--------------------------------------------

-  MNT: More changes for compatibility with developmental DataLad (#62)

0.4.2 (Oct 30, 2019) – Friends should stick together …
------------------------------------------------------

-  BF: Prevent sorting error on missing attribute (#45)
-  BF: enclose “if else” into () since it has lower precedence than +
   (#43)
-  MNT: Adjust imports for compatibility with developmental DataLad
   (#53)
-  MNT: Update save() call for compatibility with new save (#42)

0.4.1 (Jun 20, 2019) – Let us all stay friends
----------------------------------------------

-  Compatibility layer with 0.12 series of DataLad changing API (no
   backend option for ``create``)

0.4 (Mar 14, 2019) – There is more to life than a Pi
----------------------------------------------------

Primarily a variety of fixes and small enhancements. The only notable
change is stripping away testing/support of git-annex direct mode.

-  do not depend on a release candidate of the DataLad, since PIP then
   opens the way to a RCs for any later releases to be installed
-  ``simple_with_archives``

   -  issue warning if incoming_pipeline has Annexificator but no
      ``annex`` is given

-  ``crcns``

   -  skip (but warn if relevant) records without xml

-  do not crash while saving updated crawler’s URL db to the file which
   is annexed.

0.3 (Feb 06, 2019) – Happy New Year
-----------------------------------

Primarily a variety of fixes

-  ``crcns`` crawler now uses new datacite interface
-  ``openfmri`` crawler uses legacy.openfmri.org
-  ``simple_with_archives``

   -  by default now also match pure .gz files to be downloaded
   -  ``archives_re`` option provides regex for archives files (so
      ``.gz`` could be added if needed)
   -  will now run with ``tarballs=False``
   -  ``add_annex_to_incoming_pipeline`` to state either to add
      ``annex`` to the incoming pipeline

-  new ``stanford_lib`` pipeline
-  aggregation of metadata explicitly invokes incremental mode
-  tests

   -  variety of tests lost their ``@known_failure_v6`` and now
      tollerant to upcoming datalad 0.11.2

0.2 (May 17, 2018) – The other Release
--------------------------------------

-  All non-master branches in the pipelines now will initiate from
   master branch, not detached. That should allow to inherit
   .gitattributes settings of the entire dataset

0.1 (May 11, 2018) – The Release
--------------------------------

-  First release as a DataLad extension. Functionality remains identical
   to DataLad 0.10.0.rc2
